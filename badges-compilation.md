## Reflections

1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**: In this module I've learned how TypeScript is an improvement over JavaScript for web development. Also I installed TypeScript and set up a TypeScript project in Visual Studio Code. I've written my first TS function.
2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**: I've declared variables using primitives, object, inion and intersection types. 
3. **Implement Interfaces in TypeScript**: I've understood the reasons for using an interface in TypeScript, declared and instantiated an interface.
4. **Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript**: I've understood the benefits of using types in functions, wrote functions that have required, optional, default, and rest parameters.
5. **Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript**: I've understood how can I use TypeScript classes describe the shape of objects.
6. **Generics in TypeScript**: I've learned to Define a generic function, to Declare a generic interface and a generic class.
7. **Work with External Libraries in TypeScript**: I've learned how I can organize code using modules.
8. **Organize Code with Namespaces in TypeScript**: I've understood the purpose of namespaces.
