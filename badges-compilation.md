## Reflections

1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**: In this module, I learned how TypeScript improves upon JavaScript for web development. I also installed TypeScript and set up a TypeScript project in Visual Studio Code. I wrote my first TS function.
2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**: I declared variables using primitive, object, union, and intersection types. 
3. **Implement Interfaces in TypeScript**: I understood the reasons for using interfaces in TypeScript, and I declared and instantiated an interface.
4. **Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript**: I understood the benefits of using types in functions and wrote functions with required, optional, default, and rest parameters.
5. **Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript**: I understood how to use TypeScript classes to describe the shape of objects.
6. **Generics in TypeScript**: I learned to define a generic function, declare a generic interface, and declare a generic class.
7. **Work with External Libraries in TypeScript**: I learned how to organize code using modules.
8. **Organize Code with Namespaces in TypeScript**: I understood the purpose of namespaces.
